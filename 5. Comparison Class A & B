# Given data for Class A and Class B
class_A <- c(76, 35, 47, 64, 95, 66, 89, 36, 84, 76, 35, 47, 64, 95, 66, 89, 36, 84)
class_B <- c(51, 56, 84, 60, 59, 70, 63, 66, 50, 51, 56, 84, 60, 59, 70, 63, 66, 50)

# Step 1: Compute Mean, Median, and Range for both classes
mean_A <- mean(class_A)
median_A <- median(class_A)
range_A <- max(class_A) - min(class_A)

mean_B <- mean(class_B)
median_B <- median(class_B)
range_B <- max(class_B) - min(class_B)

# Display results
cat("Class A - Mean:", mean_A, ", Median:", median_A, ", Range:", range_A, "\n")
cat("Class B - Mean:", mean_B, ", Median:", median_B, ", Range:", range_B, "\n")

# Step 2: Boxplot Comparison
boxplot(class_A, class_B, 
        names = c("Class A", "Class B"),
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"),
        main = "Comparison of Class A and Class B Scores",
        ylab = "Scores",
        outline = TRUE)

# Step 3: Inferences
# - Check which class has a higher median (middle score).
# - Observe the spread (IQR and range) to determine consistency.
# - Look for outliers.
